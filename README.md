Here is the process for submitting your Device Profiles, or changes to existing Profiles:

1.) Clone the repository.  
2.) Browse to the Customer Profiles directory and create folder with your company name.  
3.) Make changes to your company directory (add new profiles or modify existing profiles).  
4.) ‘Commit’ changes and push commits  
5.) create a ‘Pull Request’ (this will trigger an email to AutomationDirect.com to look over the request).  
5.) AutomationDirect will review the ‘Pull Request’ and ‘Merge’ it into the repository if it is approved.
